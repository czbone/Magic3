*** Menu Display
------------------------------
To show the TechLine generated menu on your Joomla site please do the following:
1.	Go to Joomla Administrator (www.your-site.com/administrator) -> Extensions -> Module Manager
2.	By default Joomla contains "Top Menu" module, which has the "user3" position.
This is required for the normal display of the menu created by TechLine.
3.	If you have a different position of a menu, please change its position to "user3".

IMPORTANT! For the correct work of an TechLine-generated template,
the "user3" position can contain ONLY ONE or NO menu.
